# Contributing guidelines
How to become a contributor and submit your own code

### Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your patches!

### Contributing code

If you have improvements to this project, send us your pull requests! For those
just getting started, Github has a
[how to](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

Rentadrone.cl team members will be assigned to review your pull requests. Once the
pull requests are approved and pass continuous integration checks, a Rentadrone.cl
team member will apply `ready to pull` label to your change. This means we are
working on getting your pull request submitted to our internal repository. After
the change has been submitted internally, your pull request will be merged
automatically on GitHub.

If you want to contribute, start working through the project codebase,
navigate to the
[Github "issues" tab](https://github.com/RentadroneCL/Web-API/issues) and start
looking through interesting issues.

These are issues that we believe are particularly well suited for outside
contributions, often because we probably won't get to them right now. If you
decide to start on an issue, leave a comment so that other people know that
you're working on it. If you want to help out, but not alone, use the issue
comment thread to coordinate.

## Pull Request Checklist

Before sending your pull requests, make sure you followed this list.

- Read [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Read [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Make sure your changes are consistent with the guidelines and follow the
[PEP 8 Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
- **Add tests!** Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
- **Document any change in behaviour.** Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle.** We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- **Create feature branches.** Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
- **One pull request per feature.** If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history.** Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.
